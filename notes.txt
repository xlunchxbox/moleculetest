All the trades		DONE i think
Price Curve Type	
Market Price = settle price





What is a price curve type?
Are all the columns relevant in price curves files?
It seems like all I need is month and settle price?

In trades, does MTM Curve tell me what price curve file to use? and is this what displaying the price curve type means?

Market Price, do you want settle price per month? Average Settle price?
